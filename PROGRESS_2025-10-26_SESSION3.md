# Progress Report - Session 3 (2025-10-26)

**Session Duration**: ~2 hours
**Tasks Completed**: 2 major bug fixes

---

## Overview

This session focused on fixing two critical bugs that affected user experience:
1. Task Panel Save Button not enabling after changes
2. Status Popover showing wrong statuses in Department Tasks View

---

## Task 1: Fixed Task Panel Save Button Bug ✅

### Problem
After fixing the dashboard task panel issue in a previous session, a new bug was introduced:
- Opening Task Panel from Board/List/Calendar/Department Tasks views → Save button remains disabled
- Issue only occurred in these views, not in Dashboard
- Root cause: Race condition between form reset and submit handler registration

### Root Cause Analysis
In `task-panel/index.tsx` (lines 96-104):
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  setFormState({ ... });
  setHandleSave(null); // ❌ BUG: Reset handler on every re-render
}, [taskId, task?.statusId]); // ❌ BUG: Re-run too frequently
```

**Why it worked in Dashboard but not other views:**
- Dashboard: Fewer query invalidations, stable task data
- Board/List/Calendar/Department Tasks: Frequent optimistic updates → task object changes → useEffect re-runs → handleSave reset to null

### Solution
**File**: `src/components/task-panel/index.tsx`

**Changes**:
1. Removed `setHandleSave(null)` (line 103) - unnecessary, DetailsTab re-registers automatically
2. Changed dependencies from `[taskId, task?.statusId]` to `[taskId]` (line 107)
3. Added detailed comments explaining the fix

**Before**:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  setFormState({
    isDirty: false,
    isSubmitting: false,
    currentStatusId: task?.statusId || '',
  });
  setHandleSave(null); // ❌ Causes handler to be lost
}, [taskId, task?.statusId]); // ❌ Re-runs on every task update
```

**After**:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  setFormState({
    isDirty: false,
    isSubmitting: false,
    currentStatusId: task?.statusId || '',
  });
  // Don't reset handleSave here - DetailsTab will re-register when taskId changes
}, [taskId]); // ✅ Only re-run when opening a different task
```

### Testing Notes
Tested in all views:
- ✅ Dashboard → Open task → Edit → Save button enables
- ✅ Board View → Open task → Edit → Save button enables
- ✅ List View → Open task → Edit → Save button enables
- ✅ Calendar View → Open task → Edit → Save button enables
- ✅ Department Tasks → Open task → Edit → Save button enables

## Task 2: Fixed Status Popover Bug in Department Tasks View ✅

### Problem
In Department Tasks View, Pinned Tasks table showed incorrect statuses:
- Status popover displayed statuses from ALL pinned tasks' projects (aggregated)
- Should only show statuses from the task's own project
- Each project has custom workflow statuses

### Example
- Project A has statuses: "เริ่มงาน", "กำลังทำ", "เสร็จสิ้น"
- Project B has statuses: "รอดำเนินการ", "ดำเนินการ", "สำเร็จ"
- When editing a task from Project A in Pinned Tasks table → Saw ALL 6 statuses ❌
- Should only see Project A's 3 statuses ✅

### Root Cause
In `department-tasks-view.tsx` (line 520):
```typescript
<TaskRow
  statuses={allStatuses} // ❌ All statuses from all projects
  ...
/>
```

But in project tables (line 761):
```typescript
<TaskRow
  statuses={project.statuses} // ✅ Correct - only project's statuses
  ...
/>
```

### Solution
**Files Modified**:

#### 1. `src/hooks/use-department-tasks.ts`
- **Line 57**: Added `projectId: string` to TaskItem interface
- **Line 76**: Added `statuses: TaskStatus[]` to ProjectGroup interface

#### 2. `src/components/views/department-tasks/project-group-card.tsx`
- **Line 364**: Fixed undefined variable bug
  - Before: `projectData?.statuses` (projectData was never defined)
  - After: `project.statuses` ✅

#### 3. `src/components/views/department-tasks/department-tasks-view.tsx`
- **Lines 187-197**: Created `projectStatusesMap` to map projectId → statuses
  ```typescript
  const projectStatusesMap = useMemo(() => {
    const map = new Map();
    projects.forEach((project) => {
      if (project.statuses && Array.isArray(project.statuses)) {
        map.set(project.id, project.statuses);
      }
    });
    return map;
  }, [projects]);
  ```

- **Line 532**: Changed Pinned Tasks table to use correct statuses
  ```typescript
  <TaskRow
    statuses={projectStatusesMap.get(task.projectId) || []}
    ...
  />
  ```

### Additional Fix: Reverted Unrelated Changes
Initially misunderstood the problem and added cross-project task validation to List View. These changes were reverted as they were not related to the actual issue:
- **File**: `src/components/views/list-view/index.tsx`
- **Reverted**: All `task.projectId === projectId` checks in inline editors

### Testing Notes
- ✅ Pin tasks from multiple projects (with different statuses)
- ✅ Open status popover in Pinned Tasks table
- ✅ Each task shows only its own project's statuses
- ✅ Project tables continue to work correctly

## Files Modified

### Task Panel Fix (1 file):
1. `src/components/task-panel/index.tsx`
   - Removed `setHandleSave(null)` call
   - Changed useEffect dependencies from `[taskId, task?.statusId]` to `[taskId]`
   - Added explanatory comments

### Status Popover Fix (3 files):
1. `src/hooks/use-department-tasks.ts`
   - Added `projectId` field to TaskItem interface
   - Added `statuses` field to ProjectGroup interface

2. `src/components/views/department-tasks/project-group-card.tsx`
   - Fixed undefined variable: `projectData?.statuses` → `project.statuses`

3. `src/components/views/department-tasks/department-tasks-view.tsx`
   - Created `projectStatusesMap` for efficient lookup
   - Updated Pinned Tasks table to use project-specific statuses

---

## Technical Insights

### React Hooks Dependencies
**Learning**: Be careful with useEffect dependencies when dealing with object references
- `task?.statusId` changes reference on every re-render even if value is the same
- Use primitive values (like `taskId`) or memoized objects in dependencies
- Consider whether side effects should run on every update or only on specific changes

### State Management in Hierarchical Components
**Pattern**: Parent-child communication for form state
- Parent (TaskPanel) provides callbacks: `updateFormState`, `registerSubmitHandler`
- Child (DetailsTab) manages form state and registers submit handler
- Clean separation of concerns, no prop drilling

### Data Structure Design
**Learning**: Always include foreign keys in nested data
- TaskItem needed `projectId` to look up correct statuses
- Without it, had to aggregate all statuses (causing the bug)
- Simple addition of `projectId` enabled efficient Map lookup

---

## Impact

### User Experience
- ✅ Task Panel now works consistently across all views
- ✅ Status editing shows correct options in Department Tasks
- ✅ Prevents data inconsistency from selecting wrong statuses
- ✅ Improves confidence in the application's reliability

### Code Quality
- ✅ Removed unnecessary state resets
- ✅ Fixed undefined variable usage
- ✅ Added comprehensive comments for future developers
- ✅ Followed React best practices for useEffect dependencies

---

## Next Steps

**Recommended Testing**:
1. Test Task Panel in all views with various user roles
2. Test Department Tasks with multiple projects (different workflows)
3. Verify no regression in Board/List/Calendar inline editors

**Future Improvements**:
1. Consider memoizing more computed values in Department Tasks
2. Add TypeScript strict null checks for status/project lookups
3. Consider adding error boundaries for missing data scenarios

**Session End**: All tasks completed successfully ✅

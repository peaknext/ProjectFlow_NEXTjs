# Cross-Department Task Identification - Implementation Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Files Modified**: 7 files

---

## Overview

Implemented UI improvements to help users identify cross-department tasks in the Dashboard. This feature addresses the issue where users couldn't easily distinguish tasks that belong to other departments but are assigned to them.

### Problem Statement

Users were confused when seeing tasks from other departments in their Dashboard widgets (especially in Recent Activities). There was no visual indication that a task belonged to a different department, making it difficult to understand the task's organizational context.

### Solution

Added **department badges** to Dashboard widgets and **department information** to the Task Panel to clearly show which department owns each task.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Recent Activities API - Personal Activity Feed

**File**: `src/app/api/dashboard/activities/route.ts`

**Changes**:
- Changed scope from department-only to personal activity feed
- Now shows activities from tasks where user is:
  - Assigned (including cross-department assignments)
  - Creator
  - Has commented
  - In user's primary department

**Before**: Only showed activities from department-scoped tasks
**After**: Shows all activities user is involved with, regardless of department

**Code**:
```typescript
// Step 1: Find all tasks user is involved with
const involvedTasks = await prisma.task.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      // Tasks assigned to user (including cross-department)
      { assignees: { some: { userId } } },
      // Tasks created by user
      { creatorUserId: userId },
      // Tasks user has commented on
      { comments: { some: { commentorUserId: userId, deletedAt: null } } },
      // Tasks in user's department
      { project: { departmentId: user.departmentId } },
    ],
    deletedAt: null,
  },
  select: { id: true },
});
```

### 2. Dashboard API - Include Department Data

**File**: `src/app/api/dashboard/route.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added shared `projectSelect` constant that includes department
- Updated 4 queries to include department information:
  - Overdue Tasks
  - Pinned Tasks
  - My Tasks
  - Calendar Tasks

**Code**:
```typescript
// Shared project select for all task queries
const projectSelect = {
  id: true,
  name: true,
  department: {
    select: {
      id: true,
      name: true,
    },
  },
};
```

---

### 3. TypeScript Interface - TaskProject

**File**: `src/types/dashboard.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added optional `department` field to `TaskProject` interface

**Code**:
```typescript
export interface TaskProject {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  department?: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
  };
}
```

---

### 4. Task Panel - Department Metadata

**Files**:
- `src/components/task-panel/details-tab/task-metadata.tsx`
- `src/components/task-panel/details-tab/index.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added department row below "Created by" and "Created date" metadata
- Shows department name with label "หน่วยงาน:"
- Only displays when department data is available

**UI**:

### 5. Overdue Tasks Widget - Department Badge

**File**: `src/components/dashboard/overdue-tasks-alert.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added department badge at top-right corner (absolute positioning)
- Badge style: `text-lg px-2 py-0.5 bg-background/80 backdrop-blur-sm`
- Moved assignee avatars down (`mt-10`) to avoid overlapping with badge

**Visual**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [งานบริหารทั่วไป]    👤👤 ← Avatars │
│                                     │
│ [!] Setup Development Environment   │
│ 📁 Project A                        │
│ 📅 ครบกำหนด: 25 ต.ค. 2568          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### 6. My Tasks Widget - Department Badge

**File**: `src/components/dashboard/my-tasks-widget.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added department badge at top-right corner (absolute positioning)
- Badge style: `text-lg px-2 py-0.5 bg-background/80 backdrop-blur-sm`
- Same visual treatment as Overdue Tasks Widget

**Note**: This widget doesn't have assignee avatars, so no adjustment needed.

---

### 7. Board View - No Changes (Reverted)

**Files**:
- `src/components/views/board-view/index.tsx` (reverted)
- `src/components/views/board-view/status-column.tsx` (reverted)
- `src/components/views/board-view/task-card.tsx` (reverted)

**Rationale**: Board View is already scoped to a single project within a single department, so department badges are unnecessary and would add visual clutter.

---

## Design Decisions

### Why Union Approach for Recent Activities?

We chose to show **all tasks user is involved with** (union) rather than filtering by department because:

1. **Dashboard = Personal Workspace**: Should show everything relevant to the user
2. **Better UX**: Users don't miss important updates on cross-department tasks
3. **Cognitive Load**: No need to switch between departments to see all activities
4. **Department Tasks View**: Already exists for team/department-scoped view

### Why Only Dashboard Widgets?

Department badges were added **only to Dashboard widgets** (not Board View) because:

1. **Context**: Dashboard shows tasks from multiple departments, Board View doesn't
2. **Visual Clarity**: Dashboard needs cross-department identification, Board View doesn't
3. **Consistency**: Board View is always single-department scoped

### Badge Styling

- **Size**: `text-lg` (18px) - 2x larger than original for better visibility
- **Position**: Absolute top-right to avoid interfering with task content
- **Background**: Semi-transparent with backdrop blur for readability
- **Variant**: Outline style to differentiate from priority/status badges
